### A Quicklook
Made a quick calculator game in C++ 
``` C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> numOfOveralls;
    float taxxedNumber;
    int b;
    cout << "Enter how many overalls you want: " << endl;
    cin >> b;
    int overallPrice;
    for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
        cout << "Enter overall: " << i + 80 << "'s price: ";
        cin >> overallPrice;
        numOfOveralls.push_back(overallPrice);

    }
    cout<< "--------------------------------------"<<endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < numOfOveralls.size(); i++)
    {
        cout << "Overall: " << 80 + i << " : " << numOfOveralls[i] << endl;
        taxxedNumber = numOfOveralls[i] * .90;// will be the tax on the item
        cout << "Overall: " << (80 + i) << "'s price after tax: " << taxxedNumber << endl;
        cout<< "----------------------------------"<<endl;
    }
    cout << "All done!";
    return 0;
}

Developed a menu creation website that allowed restaurants to create and edit their menus so that they can print them all out and have them the way the want. I was partnered with two other partners for this project, Yahir and Yumong. They were both tremendous partners and I'm lucky to have them as good friends and colleagues.
```python
import csv
from entry import Entry
from menuabstract import * #inheriting abstractmethods

#This class will contain all of our functions that have to do with the inventory
class Menu(menuAbstract):
    #Yumong 5-27
    #Making a list for the menu
    def __init__(self):
        self.__list_meal = []
      
    def search_meal(self,meal):  #Returns other values in accordance with meal name
        #__list_meal is dependent on create inventory, since we are only putting in one line with the
        #
        for i in self.__list_meal:
            if i.get_meal() == meal:
                return i
        return None

    # This is a search function that returns a list of
    # entries with the same type
    # take the type, compare the type of every entry to the given type
    def search_type(self, type):
        a = []
        for i in self.__list_meal:

        return a

        )
        for i in range(len(self.__list_meal)):

#we want to entry to be our linked list now instead of our list
                self.__list_meal.append(entry)  # Appends the menu

    # I believe I need to make a new function which reads restaurant but will simply take all the lines
    # I disliked repeating myself over and over again
